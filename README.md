Istanbul, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural and historic center. With a total population of  sixteen million residents, Istanbul is one of the world's largest cities. Istanbul has attracted by many different investors with different industries. Construction is the key of driving other investors in the city. 

Istanbul has many attraction point, some of them are really old, some of them young. Istanbul is also a diverse city, there is a huge difference between the city center(s) and their urban areas. Rental costs are the biggest cost item for the venues, alcoholic beverages are strongly taxed. 

Last couple of years, USD/TRY index was dramatically increased, it has affected most industries badly. This means that, conditions are tougher than before for the food & beverage industry and the restaurants which targeting white collar customers living near to the city center.

### Problem
Istanbul has one of the most crowded traffic jam in the world. Accessing good restaurants take plenty of time for the white collars who didn't live in the city centers. Finding decent restaurant spots near to the urban areas of the city is a big issue. It's really common thing to find good restaurants near home, it requires a trip. We will be looking at the major suburb neighbors with mid-high income and examine which neighbour is having the best opportunity to invest.
