Last couple of years, USD/TRY index was dramatically increased, it has affected most industries badly. This means that, conditions are tougher than before for the food & beverage industry and the restaurants which targeting white collar customers living near to the city center.

### Problem
Istanbul has one of the most crowded traffic jam in the world. Accessing good restaurants take plenty of time for the white collars who didn't live in the city centers. Finding decent restaurant spots near to the urban areas of the city is a big issue. It's really common thing to find good restaurants near home, it requires a trip.
